# 4043. Count Rotations With Exactly K Equal Adjacent Pairs

[LeetCode Problem](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-rotations-with-exactly-k-equal-adjacent-pairs/)

**Difficulty:** Easy

## Problem Statement

You are given a string `s` of length `n` and an integer `k`.

A **cyclic rotation** of `s` is obtained by choosing a prefix of `s` whose length is between 0 and `n - 1` (inclusive), and moving it to the end of the string while preserving the order of all characters.

For **every** cyclic rotation of `s`, let its **score** be the number of indices `i` such that `0 <= i < n - 1` and the characters at positions `i` and `i + 1` are equal.

Return the number of cyclic rotations of `s` whose score equals `k`.

## Examples

### Example 1

**Input:** `s = "aab", k = 1`

**Output:** `2`

**Explanation:**

The cyclic rotations of `s` are:

- `"aab"`: The characters at positions 0 and 1 are equal, so `score = 1`.
- `"aba"`: No two adjacent characters are equal, so `score = 0`.
- `"baa"`: The characters at positions 1 and 2 are equal, so `score = 1`.

Since `score` equals `k` for 2 cyclic rotations of `s`, the answer is 2.

### Example 2

**Input:** `s = "abca", k = 0`

**Output:** `1`

**Explanation:**

The cyclic rotations of `s` are:

- `"abca"`: No two adjacent characters are equal, so `score = 0`.
- `"bcaa"`: The characters at positions 2 and 3 are equal, so `score = 1`.
- `"caab"`: The characters at positions 1 and 2 are equal, so `score = 1`.
- `"aabc"`: The characters at positions 0 and 1 are equal, so `score = 1`.

Since `score` equals `k` for only 1 cyclic rotation of `s`, the answer is 1.

## Constraints

- `2 <= n == s.length <= 100`
- `s` only consists of lowercase English letters.
- `0 <= k <= n - 1`

## Approach

We need to count how many rotations have exactly `k` equal adjacent pairs.

Instead of creating every rotated string and calculating its complete score again, we calculate the first score and then update the score as the rotation changes.

The important idea is:

> When moving to the next rotation, only two adjacent comparisons change.

### Step 1: Calculate the Initial Score

Start with:

```text
score = 0
ans = 0
